# Working with 'real' data



*Note: If you already have nicely formatted data ready for use in R then you could skip this section and revisit it later.*

Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to illustrate particular techniques. However in the real-world our data can be:

- In the wrong format
- Spread across multiple files
- Badly coded, or with errors
- Incomplete, with values missing for many different reasons


This chapter shows you how to address each of these problems.



##  How to 'tidy' data

- Melt, spread
- ...



## Deal with multiple files

- File handling and import
- Writing a function for `do()` which returns a dataframe
- Joins and merges



##  Error checking

- `999`, `666` and `*`: the marks of the beast!



## Missing values

- `is.na()` and `is.finite`
- `expand()`
