# 'Real' data {#real-data}

_Note: If you already lucky enough to have nicely formatted data, ready for use
in R, then you could skip this section and revisit it later,_ save for the
section on [factors and other variable types](#factors-and-numerics).

Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to illustrate
particular techniques. However in the real-world our data can be:

-   In the wrong format
-   Spread across multiple files
-   Badly coded, or with errors
-   Incomplete, with values missing for many different reasons

This chapter will give you techniques to address each of these problems.
