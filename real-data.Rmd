Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to illustrate particular techniques. However in the real-world our data can be:

- In the wrong format
- Spread across multiple files
- Badly coded, or with errors
- Incomplete, with values missing for many different reasons


This chapter shows you how to address each of these problems.



# 'Tidy' data

- Melt, spread
- ...


# Dealing with multiple files

- File handling and import
- Joins and merges


#  Error checking

- `999`, `666` and `*`: the marks of the beast!


# Missing values

- `is.na()`
- `expand()`
