# 'Real' data {#real-data}

*Note: If you already lucky enough to have nicely formatted data, ready for use in R, then you could skip this section and revisit it later,* save for the section on [factors and other variable types](#factors-and-numerics).

Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to illustrate particular techniques. However in the real-world our data can be:

- In the wrong format
- Spread across multiple files
- Badly coded, or with errors
- Incomplete, with values missing for many different reasons


This chapter will give you techniques to address each of these problems.
