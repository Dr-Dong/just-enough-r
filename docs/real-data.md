# Working with 'real' data



Most tutorials and textbooks use neatly formatted example datasets to illustrate particular techniques. However in the real-world our data can be:

- In the wrong format
- Spread across multiple files
- Badly coded, or with errors
- Incomplete, with values missing for many different reasons


This chapter shows you how to address each of these problems.



## 'Tidy' data

- Melt, spread
- ...


## Dealing with multiple files

- File handling and import
- Joins and merges


##  Error checking

- `999`, `666` and `*`: the marks of the beast!


## Missing values

- `is.na()`
- `expand()`
