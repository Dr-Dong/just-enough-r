# (PART) Data {- #data}

# The `dataframe` {#datasets-dataframes}

A `dataframe` is a container for our data.

It's much like a spreadsheet, but with some constraints applied.  'Constraints' might sound bad, but they're actually helpful: they make dataframes more structured and predictable to work with. The main constraints are that:

- Each column is a [vector](#vectors-and-lists), and so can [only store one type of data](#vectors-and-lists).

- Every column has to be the same length (although missing values are allowed).

- Each column must have a name.


A `tibble` is an updated version of a dataframe with a whimsical name, which is part of the `tidyverse`. It's almost exactly the same a dataframe, but with some rough edges smoothed off â€” it's safe and preferred to use `tibble` in place of `data.frame`.


You can make a simple tibble or dataframe like this:


```r
data.frame(myvariable = 1:10)
   myvariable
1           1
2           2
3           3
4           4
5           5
6           6
7           7
8           8
9           9
10         10
```

Using a tible is much the same, but allows some extra tricks like creating one variable from another:



```r
tibble(
	height_m = rnorm(10, 1.5, .2),
	weight_kg = rnorm(10, 65, 10),
	bmi = weight_kg / height_m ^ 2,
	overweight = bmi > 25
)
# A tibble: 10 x 4
   height_m weight_kg   bmi overweight
      <dbl>     <dbl> <dbl> <lgl>     
 1     1.54      56.9  23.8 FALSE     
 2     1.62      73.2  27.8 TRUE      
 3     1.44      75.7  36.4 TRUE      
 4     1.42      78.8  38.9 TRUE      
 5     1.31      62.9  36.4 TRUE      
 6     1.31      73.1  42.4 TRUE      
 7     1.45      77.6  37.0 TRUE      
 8     1.70      64.7  22.4 FALSE     
 9     1.31      67.6  39.6 TRUE      
10     1.07      66.0  57.8 TRUE      
```




#### Using 'built in' data {- #built-in-data}


The quickest way to see a dataframe in action is to use one that is built in to R ([this page](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) lists all the built-in datasets). For example:


```r
head(airquality)
  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3
4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4
5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5
6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6
```

Or


```r
head(mtcars)
                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```

In both these examples the datasets are already loaded and available to be used with the `head()` function.



:::{.exercise}

To find a list of all the built in datasets you can type `help(datasets)` into the console, or see <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html>. 

Familiarise yourself with some of the other included datasets, e.g. `datasets::attitude`. Watch out that not all the included datasets are *dataframes*: Some are just vectors of observations (e.g. the `airmiles` data) and some are 'time-series', (e.g. the `co2` data)

#### Looking at dataframes {- #looking-at-data}

As we've already seen, using `print(df)` within an RMarkdown document creates a nice interactive table you can use to look at your data.

However you won't want to print your whole data file when you Knit your RMarkdown document. The `head` function can be useful if you just want to show a few rows:


```r
head(mtcars)
                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2
Valiant           18.1   6  225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
```


Or we can use `glimpse()` function from the `dplyr::` package (see the [section on loading and using packages](#packages)) for a different view of the first few rows of the `mtcars` data. This flips the dataframe so the variables are listed in the first column of the output:


```r
glimpse(mtcars)
Observations: 32
Variables: 11
$ mpg  <dbl> 21.0, 21.0, 22.8, 21.4, 18.7, 18.1, 14.3, 24.4, 22.8, 19....
$ cyl  <dbl> 6, 6, 4, 6, 8, 6, 8, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, ...
$ disp <dbl> 160.0, 160.0, 108.0, 258.0, 360.0, 225.0, 360.0, 146.7, 1...
$ hp   <dbl> 110, 110, 93, 110, 175, 105, 245, 62, 95, 123, 123, 180, ...
$ drat <dbl> 3.90, 3.90, 3.85, 3.08, 3.15, 2.76, 3.21, 3.69, 3.92, 3.9...
$ wt   <dbl> 2.620, 2.875, 2.320, 3.215, 3.440, 3.460, 3.570, 3.190, 3...
$ qsec <dbl> 16.46, 17.02, 18.61, 19.44, 17.02, 20.22, 15.84, 20.00, 2...
$ vs   <dbl> 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ...
$ am   <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ...
$ gear <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...
$ carb <dbl> 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 2, ...
```


You can use the `pander()` function (from the `pander::` package) to format tables nicely, for when you Knit a document to HTML, Word or PDF. For example:


```r
library(pander)
pander(head(airquality), caption="Tables always need a caption.")
```


---------------------------------------------
 Ozone   Solar.R   Wind   Temp   Month   Day 
------- --------- ------ ------ ------- -----
  41       190     7.4     67      5      1  

  36       118      8      72      5      2  

  12       149     12.6    74      5      3  

  18       313     11.5    62      5      4  

  NA       NA      14.3    56      5      5  

  28       NA      14.9    66      5      6  
---------------------------------------------

Table: Tables always need a caption.


See the section on [sharing and publishing](#sharing-and-publication) for more ways to format and present tables.


Other useful functions for looking at and exploring datasets include:

- `summary(df)`
- `psych::describe(df)`
- `skimr::skim(df)`


:::{.exercise}

Experiment with a few of the functions for viewing/summarising dataframes.

There are also some helpful plotting functions which accept a whole dataframe as their input:


```r
boxplot(airquality)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="DATASETS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" alt="Box plot of all variables in a dataset." width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-10)Box plot of all variables in a dataset.</p>
</div>


```r
psych::cor.plot(airquality)
```

<div class="figure">
<img src="DATASETS_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" alt="Correlation heatmap of all variables in a dataset. Colours indicate size of the correlation between pairs of variables." width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:unnamed-chunk-11)Correlation heatmap of all variables in a dataset. Colours indicate size of the correlation between pairs of variables.</p>
</div>

These plots might not be worth including in a final write-up, but are very useful when exploring your data.
