# Introduction

R is software which makes it easy to work with and learn from data. 

It also happens to be a complete programmming language, but if you're reading this guide then that might not be of interest to you. That's OK â€” the goal here is *not* to teach you how to program in R^[This is actually a lie, but I'm hoping you won't notice until it's too late.].  The goal is to teach you *just enough R* to be confident to explore your data.

We are going to use R the same way we use any other statistics software: To check and visualise data, run statistical analyses, and share our results with others.  To do that it's worth learning the *absolute basics* of the R language. The next few chapters walk you through those basics: what you need to know to be productive in R and RStudio. By analogy, imagine going on holiday and learning enough French to introduce yourself, count from one to ten, and order a baguette. You won't be fluent - but you won't starve, and your trip will be more fun.


## How the guide is structured

Part 1 is meant to be read from beginning to end by those starting from scratch.

Part 2 can be read sequentially, but these chapters are also designed to work as standalone guides for specific techniques. 

Part 3 should be used interactively to answer questions that arise along the way. 



### Part 1: Must read

1. [Getting started](start_here.html) 
2. [Datasets and dataframes](datasets.html)
2. [Manipulating dataframes](working-with-dataframes.html) (select and filter)
3. [Summarising data](summarising-data.html) (split, apply, combine)
4. [Visualising data](graphics.html) (layering graphics with `ggplot2`)
5. [Linear models](linear-models-simple.html)



### Part 2: Nice to know

1. [Working with real data](real-data.html)
1. [Correlations](correlations.html)
1. [t-tests](t-tests.html)
1. [Understanding interactions](understanding-interactions.html) (visualising interactions in raw data)
1. [Predictions and marginal effects](predictions-and-margins.html)
1. [Mediation](mediation.html)
1. [Linear mixed models (multilevel models)](multilevel-models.html)
1. Meta analysis
1. [Confirmatory factor analysis](cfa.html) 
1. Structural Equation Modelling
1. Power analysis
1. ... ^[It would also be lovely to have chapters on multiple imputation, power analysis, simulation, Bayesian modelling and much else. These aren't planned imminently, but contributions are welcome.]



### Part 3: Loose ends

Some of the content here is not specific to R, but may be useful in interpreting the output of some of the techniques taught in sections 1 and 2.

- [Installing RStudio](installation.html)
- [Installing packages](packages.html)
- [Handling missing values in R](missing-values.html)
- [Using RMarkdown effectively](rmarkdown-tricks.html) (e.g. using `pander` and `knitr`)
- [Confidence intervals vs. prediction intervals](confidence-vs-prediction-intervals.html)




## A warning

This guide is extremely opinionated. 

There are many ways to get things done with R, but trying to learn them all at once causes unhappiness. In particular, lots of the base R functions are old, quirky, inconstently named, and hard to remember. This guide recommends that you use several new 'packages' that replicate and extend some of R's basic functionality. Using this new set of packages, which are very thoughtfull designed and work together nicely, will help you form a more consistent mental model of how to work in R. You can learn the crufty old bits (which do still have their uses) later on.

I also assume you are using the RStudio editor and working in an RMarkdown document (see the next section). This is important because this guide itself is written in RMarkdown, and editing it will be an important part of the learning process. If you don't have access to RStudio yet, see the [installation guide](installation.html).
