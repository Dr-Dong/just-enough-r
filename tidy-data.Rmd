## Tidying data {- #tidyingdata}


'Tidying' data means converting it into the format that is most useful for data analyses, and so we have already covered many of the key techniques: selecting and filtering data, reshaping and summarising.

However the ideas behind 'tidying' draw together other related concepts which link together the way we enter, store and process data: for example the idea of '[relational data]()' and techniques to join together related datasets.
