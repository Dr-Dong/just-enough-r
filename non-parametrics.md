## Non-parametric statistics {#nonparametrics}

This guide is very light on non-parametric statistics in R.

For more on this topic
[this page on the statmethods site](http://www.statmethods.net/stats/nonparametric.html)
is a useful guide.

The [`coin::` package](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/library/coin/doc/coin.pdf)
implements many resampling tests, which can also be useful when assumptions of
parametric tests are not valid.
[See this intro to resampling statistics](http://www.statmethods.net/stats/resampling.html).
