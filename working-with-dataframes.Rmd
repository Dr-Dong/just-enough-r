## Working with dataframes {- #working-with-dataframes}

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE, cache=TRUE, message=F)
library(tidyverse)
library(tufte)
library(pander)
```


### Introducing the `tidyverse` {- #tidyverse}

R includes hundreds of built-in ways to select individual elements, rows or columns from a dataframe.  This guide isn't going to teach you many of them.

The truth is that R can be overwhelming to new users, especially those new to programming. R is sometimes _too_ powerful and flexible: there are too many different to accomplish the same end, and this can lead to confusion.

Recently, a suite of packages has been developed for R which tries to provide a simple, consistent set of tools for working with data and graphics.

This suite of packages is called the *tidyverse*, and you can load all of these packages by calling:

```{r, echo=T, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
```


In this guide we make much use of two components from the tidyverse:

- `dplyr`: to select, filter and summarise data
- `ggplot2`: to make plots

It's strongly recommended that you use these in your own code.





## Selecting columns {- #selecting-columns}


###### Selecting a single column {-}

Because dataframes act like lists of vectors, we can access columns from them using the `$` symbol. For example, here we select the `Ozone` column, which returns a vector of the observations made:

```{r}
airquality$Ozone
```


And we can pass this vector to functions, for example `summary()`:

```{r}
summary(airquality$Ozone)
```




###### Selecting more than one column {-}

To select multiple columns the `select()` function from `dplyr` is the simplest solution. You give `select()` a dataframe plus the names of the columns you want, and it returns a new dataframe with just those columns, in the order you specified:


```{r}
head(
  select(mtcars, cyl, hp)
)
```


Because all the main `dplyr` functions tend to return a new dataframe, we can assign the results to a variable, and use that as normal:

```{r}
cylandweight <- select(mtcars, cyl, wt)
summary(cylandweight)
```


You can also put a minus (`-`) sign in front of the column name to indicate which columns you don't want:


```{r}
head(select(airquality, -Ozone, -Solar.R, -Wind))
```



You can use a patterns to match a subset of the columns you want. For example, here we select all the columns where the name contains the letter `d`:

```{r}
head(select(mtcars, contains("d")))
```


And you can combine these techniques to make more complex selections:

```{r}
head(select(mtcars, contains("d"), -drat))
```


As a quick reference, you can use the following 'verbs' to select columns in different ways:


- `starts_with()`
- `ends_with()`
- `contains()`
- `everything()`



There are other commands too, but these are probably the most useful to begin with. See the help files for more information.


## Selecting rows {- #selecting-rows}

To select particular rows from a dataframe, `dplyr` provides the `filter()` function. 

If we only want to see the 6-cylindered cars from the `mtcars` dataframe:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl==6)
```

The `filter` function selects rows matching criteria you set: in this case, that `cyl==6`. We can match two criteria at once if needed:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl==6 & gear==3)
```



## 'Operators' {- #operators}

<!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4TYv2PhG89A?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 -->

When selecting rows in the [example above](#selecting-rows) we used two equals signs `==` to compare values. 

However, there are other operators we can use to create filters. Rather than describe them, the examples below demonstrate what each of them do.



###### Equality and matching {-}

To compare a single value we use `==`

```{r}
2 == 2
```

And in a filter:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, cyl==6)
```



###### {- .explainer}

You might have noted above that we write `==` rather than just `=` to define the criteria. This is because most programming languages, including R, use two `=` symbols to distinguish: *comparison* from *assignment*.



###### Presence/absence {-}


To test if a value is in a vector of suitable matches we can use: `%in%`:

```{r}
2 %in% 1:10
100 %in% 1:10
```

And, perhaps less obviously, we can test whether each value in a vector is in a second vector. This returns a vector of `TRUE/FALSE` values as long as the first list:

```{r}
c(1, 2) %in% c(2, 3, 4)
```

And this is very useful in a dataframe filter:


```{r}
head(filter(mtcars, cyl %in% c(4, 6)))
```




###### Greater/less than {-}

The `<` and `>` symbols work as you'd expect:

```{r, eval=F}
head(filter(mtcars, cyl > 4))
head(filter(mtcars, cyl < 5))
```


You can also use `>=` and `<=`:

```{r, eval=F}
filter(mtcars, cyl >= 6)
filter(mtcars, cyl <= 4)
```



###### Negation (opposite of) {-}

The `!` is very useful to tell R to reverse an expression; that is, take the opposite of the value. In the simplest example:


```{r}
!TRUE
```

This is helpful because we can reverse the meaning of other expressions:

```{r}
is.na(NA)
!is.na(NA)
```

And we can use in filters. Here we select rows where `Ozone` is missing (`NA`):

```{r, eval=F}
filter(airquality, is.na(Ozone))
```

And here we use `!` to reverse the expression and select rows which are not missing:

```{r, eval=F}
filter(airquality, !is.na(Ozone))
```


[Try running these commands for yourself and experiment with changing the operators to make select different combinations of rows]{.exercise}




###### Other logical operators {-}


There are operators for 'and'/'or' which can combine other filters

```{r}
filter(mtcars, hp > 200 | wt > 4)
```

Using `&` (and) makes the filter more restrictive:

```{r}
filter(mtcars, hp > 200 & wt > 4)
```


Finally, you can set the order in which operators are applied by using parentheses. This means these expressions are subtly different:

```{r}
# first
filter(mtcars, (hp > 200 & wt > 4) | cyl==8)

# second reordered evaluation
filter(mtcars, hp > 200 & (wt > 4 | cyl==8))
```


[Try writing in plain English the meaning of the two filter expressions above]{.exercise}






## Sorting {- #sorting}

You can sort dataframes with `arrange()`:

```{r}
airquality %>% 
  arrange(Ozone) %>% 
  head
```


By default sorting is ascending, but you can use a minus sign to reverse this:

```{r}
airquality %>% 
  arrange(-Ozone) %>% 
  head
```


You can sort on multiple columns too, but the order of the variables makes a difference:

```{r}
airquality %>% 
  select(Month, Ozone) %>% 
  arrange(Month, -Ozone) %>% 
  head


airquality %>% 
  select(Month, Ozone) %>% 
  arrange(-Ozone, Month) %>% 
  head
```







## Pipes {- #pipes}

We often want to combine `select` and `filter` (and other functions) to return a subset of our original data.

As you might have noticed above, we can 'nest' function calls in R. For example, we might want to select specific columns and filter out some rows.

Taking the `mtcars` data, we might want to select the weights of only those cars with low `mpg`:

```{r}
gas.guzzlers <- select(filter(mtcars, mpg < 15), wt)
summary(gas.guzzlers)
```


This is OK, but can get quite confusing to read, and the more deeply functions are nested the easier it is to make a mistake.



#### `dplyr` provides an alternative to nested function calls, called the pipe. {-}

Imagine your dataframe as a big bucket containing data. From this bucket, you can 'pour' your data down through a series of tubes and filters, until at the bottom of your screen you have a smaller bucket containing just the data you want.


![Think of your data 'flowing' down the screen.](media/tubes.jpg)


To make data flow from one bucket to another, we use the 'pipe' operator: `%>%`

```{r}
# dataframes are just 'buckets' of data
big.bucket.of.data <- mtcars

big.bucket.of.data %>%
  filter(mpg <15) %>%
  select(wt) %>%
  summary
```


So we have achieved the same outcome, but the code reads as a series of operations which the data flows through, connected by our pipes (the `%>%`). At the end of the last pipe, our data gets dumped into the `summary()` function^[You might notice that when we write the `select` function we don't explicitly name the dataframe to be used. This is because R *implicitly* passes the output of the pipe to the first argument of the function. So here, the output of `filter(mpg<15)` is used as the dataframe in the `select` function.]

We could just as well have saved this smaller 'bucket' of data so we can use it later on:

```{r}
smaller.bucket <- big.bucket.of.data %>%
  filter(mpg <15) %>%
  select(wt)
```


This turns out to be an incredibly useful pattern when processing and working with data. We can pour data through a series of filters and other operations, saving intermediate states where necessary.


[You can insert the `%>%` symbol in RStdudio by typing `cmd-shift-M`, which saves a lot of typing.]{.explainer}







## Modifying and creating new columns {- #mutate}


Often when working with data we want to compute new values from columns we already have. 

Let's imagine we have collected data from patients using the [PHQ-9](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Documents/Mood%20self-assessment.htm) questionnaire, which [measures depression](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x/abstract):


```{r}
phq9.df <- readr::read_csv("phq.csv")
glimpse(phq9.df)
```


Each patients' PHQ-9 score is calculated by summing all of the individual item scores. So - we want to create a new column containing the sum of each row.  This is fairly easy with the `dplyr::mutate()` function:


```{r}
phq9.scored.df <- phq9.df %>%
mutate(phq9 = phq9_01 + phq9_02 + phq9_03 + phq9_04 +
         phq9_05 + phq9_06 + phq9_07 + phq9_08 + phq9_09)

phq9.scored.df %>%
  select(patient, group, month, phq9) %>%
  head
```

Notice that we first stored the computed scores in `phq9.scored.df` and then used `select()` to get rid of the raw data columns to display only what we needed.

See this section on [summarising and processing data](#split-apply-combine) for a [neater way to create summary scores](#mutate-with-rowmeans) in this sort of situation.
