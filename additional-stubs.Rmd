Tongue in cheek Chapter that Andy proposed as a Stage 4 option: "doing BF for rubbish data..."

Cover:

- What is a BF: http://bayesfactor.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the-bayesfactor-package-this-blog-is.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor#Interpretation

- BF package manual http://bayesfactorpcl.r-forge.r-project.org/#twosample

- BayesFactors not (too) sensitive to choice of priors:  http://www.nicebread.de/interactive-exploration-of-a-priors-impact/



Also explore parameter estimation and inference from posterior of parameters as an alternative approach (see Krusche chapter, and Gelman papers).
